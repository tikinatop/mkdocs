# Configuration

Guide to all available configuration settings.

---

## Introduction

Project settings are always configured by using a YAML configuration file in the
project directory named `mkdocs.yml`.

As a minimum this configuration file must contain the `site_name` setting. All
other settings are optional.

## Project information

### site_name

This is a **required setting**, and should be a string that is used as the main
title for the project documentation. For example:

```yaml
site_name: Marshmallow Generator
```

When rendering the theme this setting will be passed as the `site_name` context
variable.

### site_url

Set the canonical URL of the site. This will add a link tag with the canonical
URL to the generated HTML header.

**default**: `null`

### repo_url

When set, provides a link to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository on each page.

```yaml
repo_url: https://github.com/example/repository/
```

**default**: `null`

### repo_name

When set, provides a link to your GitHub or Bitbucket repository on each page.

**default**: `'GitHub'` or `'Bitbucket'` if the `repo_url` matches those
domains, otherwise `null`

### edit_uri

Path from the base `repo_url` to the docs directory when directly viewing a
page, accounting for specifics of the repository host (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket,
etc), the branch, and the docs directory itself. Mkdocs concatenates `repo_url`
and `edit_uri`, and appends the input path of the page.

When set, provides a link directly to the page in your source repository. This
makes it easier to find and edit the source for the page. If `repo_url` is not
set, this option is ignored.

For example, for a GitHub-hosted repository, the `edit_uri` would be as follows.
(Note the `edit` path and `master` branch...)

```yaml
edit_uri: edit/master/docs/
```

For a Bitbucket-hosted repository, the equivalent `edit_uri` would be as
follows. (Note the `src` path and `default` branch...)

```yaml
edit_uri: src/default/docs/
```

For other repository hosts, `edit_uri` works the same way. Simply specify the
relative path to the docs directory.

**default**: `edit/master/docs/` or `src/default/docs/` for GitHub or Bitbucket
repos, respectively, if `repo_url` matches those domains, otherwise `null`

!!! note "Note:"
    On GitHub, the `edit` path opens the page in the online GitHub editor. This
    functionality requires that the user have and be logged in to a GitHub
    account. Otherwise, the user will be redirected to a login/signup page.
    Alternatively, use the `blob` path to open a read-only view, which supports
    anonymous access. E.g. `blob/master/docs/`

### site_description

Set the site description. This will add a meta tag to the generated HTML header.

**default**: `null`

### site_author

Set the name of the author. This will add a meta tag to the generated HTML
header.

**default**: `null`

### copyright

Set the copyright information to be included in the documentation by the theme.

**default**: `null`

### google_analytics

Set the Google analytics tracking configuration.

```yaml
google_analytics: ['UA-36723568-3', 'mkdocs.org']
```

**default**: `null`

### remote_branch

Set the remote branch to commit to when using `gh-deploy` to deploy to Github
Pages. This option can be overridden by a command line option in `gh-deploy`.

**default**: `gh-pages`

### remote_name

Set the remote name to push to when using `gh-deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
This option can be overridden by a command line option in `gh-deploy`.

**default**: `gh-pages`

## Documentation layout

### pages

This setting is used to determine the set of pages that should be built for the
documentation. For example, the following would create Introduction, User Guide
and About pages, given the three source files `index.md`, `user-guide.md` and
`about.md`, respectively.

```yaml
pages:
    - 'Introduction': 'index.md'
    - 'User Guide': 'user-guide.md'
    - 'About': 'about.md'
```

See the section on [configuring pages and navigation] for a more detailed
breakdown, including how to create sub-sections.

**default**: By default `pages` will contain an alphanumerically sorted, nested
list of all the Markdown files found within the `docs_dir` and its
sub-directories. If none are found it will be `[]` (an empty list).

## Build directories

### theme

Sets the theme of your documentation site, for a list of available themes visit
[styling your docs].

**default**: `'mkdocs'`

### theme_dir

Lets you set a directory to a custom theme. This can either be a relative
directory, in which case it is resolved relative to the directory containing
your configuration file, or it can be an absolute directory path.

See [styling your docs][theme_dir] for details if you would like to tweak an
existing theme.

See [custom themes] if you would like to build your own theme from the ground
up.

**default**: `null`

### docs_dir

Lets you set the directory containing the documentation source markdown files.
This can either be a relative directory, in which case it is resolved relative
to the directory containing you configuration file, or it can be an absolute
directory path.

**default**: `'docs'`

### site_dir

Lets you set the directory where the output HTML and other files are created.
This can either be a relative directory, in which case it is resolved relative
to the directory containing you configuration file, or it can be an absolute
directory path.

**default**: `'site'`

!!! note "Note:"
    If you are using source code control you will normally want to ensure that
    your *build output* files are not committed into the repository, and only
    keep the *source* files under version control. For example, if using `git`
    you might add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

        site/

    If you're using another source code control tool, you'll want to check its
    documentation on how to ignore specific directories.

### extra_css

Set a list of CSS files in your `docs_dir` to be included by the theme. For
example, the following example will include the the extra.css file within the
css subdirectory in your [docs_dir](#docs_dir).

```yaml
extra_css:
    - css/extra.css
    - css/second_extra.css
```

**default**: `[]` (an empty list).

### extra_javascript

Set a list of JavaScript files in your `docs_dir` to be included by the theme.
See the example in [extra_css] for usage.

**default**: `[]` (an empty list).

### extra_templates

Set a list of templates in your `docs_dir` to be built by MkDocs. To see more
about writing templates for MkDocs read the documentation about [custom themes]
and specifically the section about the [variables that are available] to
templates. See the example in [extra_css] for usage.

**default**: `[]` (an empty list).

### extra

A set of key value pairs, where the values can be any valid YAML construct, that
will be passed to the template. This allows for great flexibility when creating
custom themes.

For example, if you are using a theme that supports displaying the project
version, you can pass it to the theme like this:

```yaml
extra:
    version: 1.0
```

**default**: By default `extra` will be an empty key value mapping.

## Preview controls

### use_directory_urls

This setting controls the style used for linking to pages within the
documentation.

The following table demonstrates how the URLs used on the site differ when
setting `use_directory_urls` to `true` or `false`.

Source file  | Generated HTML       | use_directory_urls=true  | use_directory_urls=false
------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------
index.md     | index.html           | /                        | /index.html
api-guide.md | api-guide/index.html | /api-guide/              | /api-guide/index.html
about.md     | about/index.html     | /about/                  | /about/index.html

The default style of `use_directory_urls=true` creates more user friendly URLs,
and is usually what you'll want to use.

The alternate style can occasionally be useful if you want your documentation to
remain properly linked when opening pages directly from the file system, because
it create links that point directly to the target *file* rather than the target
*directory*.

**default**: `true`

### strict

Determines if a broken link to a page within the documentation is considered a
warning or an error (link to a page not listed in the pages setting). Set to
true to halt processing when a broken link is found, false prints a warning.

**default**: `false`

### dev_addr

Determines the address used when running `mkdocs serve`. Setting this allows you
to use another port, or allows you to make the service accessible over your
local network by using the `0.0.0.0` address.

As with all settings, you can set this from the command line, which can be
useful, for example:

```bash
mkdocs serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:80  # Run on port 80, on the local network.
```

**default**: `'127.0.0.1:8000'`

## Formatting options

### markdown_extensions

MkDocs uses the [Python Markdown][pymkd] library to translate Markdown files
into HTML. Python Markdown supports a variety of [extensions][pymdk-extensions]
that customize how pages are formatted. This setting lets you enable a list of
extensions beyond the ones that MkDocs uses by default (`meta`, `toc`, `tables`,
and `fenced_code`).

For example, to enable the [SmartyPants typography extension][smarty], use:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
    - smarty
```

Some extensions provide configuration options of their own. If you would like to
set any configuration options, then you can nest a key/value mapping
(`option_name: option value`) of any options that a given extension supports.
See the documentation for the extension you are using to determine what options
they support.

For example, to enable permalinks in the (included) `toc` extension, use:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
    - toc:
        permalink: True
```

Note that a colon (`:`) must follow the extension name (`toc`) and then on a new
line the option name and value must be indented and seperated by a colon. If you
would like to define multipe options for a single extension, each option must be
defined on a seperate line:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
    - toc:
        permalink: True
        separator: "_"
```

Add an additional item to the list for each extension. If you have no
configuration options to set for a specific extension, then simply omit options
for that extension:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
    - smarty
    - toc:
        permalink: True
    - sane_lists
```

!!! note "See Also:"
    The Python-Markdown documentation provides a [list of extensions][exts]
    which are available out-of-the-box. For a list of configuration options
    available for a given extension, see the documentation for that extension.

    You may also install and use various [third party extensions][3rd]. Consult
    the documentation provided by those extensions for installation instructions
    and available configuration options.
