# Styling your docs

How to style and theme your documentation.

---

MkDocs includes a couple [built-in themes] as well as various [third party
themes], all of which can easily be customized with [extra CSS or
JavaScript][docs_dir] or overridden from the [theme directory][theme_dir]. You
can also create your own [custom theme] from the grown up for your
documentation.

To use a theme that is included in MkDocs, simply add this to your
`mkdocs.yml` config file.

    theme: readthedocs

Replace [`readthedocs`](#readthedocs) with any of the [built-in themes] listed below.

To create a new custom theme see the [Custom Themes][custom theme] page, or to
more heavily customize an existing theme, see
the [Customizing a Theme][customize] section below.

## Built-in themes

### Third Party Themes

A list of third party themes can be found in the MkDocs [community wiki]. If you
have created your own, please feel free to add it to the list.

## Customizing a Theme

If you would like to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, there is no need to
create your own theme from scratch. For minor tweaks which only require some CSS
and/or JavaScript, you can use the [docs_dir]. However, for more complex
customizations, including overriding templates, you will need to use the
[theme_dir].

### Using the docs_dir

The [extra_css] and [extra_javascript] configuration options can be used to
make tweaks and customizations to existing themes. To use these, you simply
need to include either CSS or JavaScript files within your [documentation
directory].

For example, to change the colour of the headers in your documentation, create
a file called `extra.css` and place it next to the documentation Markdown. In
that file add the following CSS.

```CSS
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

!!! note

    If you are deploying your documentation with [ReadTheDocs]. You will need
    to explicitly list the CSS and JavaScript files you want to include in
    your config. To do this, add the following to your mkdocs.yml.

        extra_css: [extra.css]

After making these changes, they should be visible when you run
`mkdocs serve` - if you already had this running, you should see that the CSS
changes were automatically picked up and the documentation will be updated.

!!! note

    Any extra CSS or JavaScript files will be added to the generated HTML
    document after the page content. If you desire to include a JavaScript
    library, you may have better success including the library by using the
    [theme_dir].

### Using the theme_dir

The [theme_dir] configuration option can be used to point to a directory of
files which override the files in the theme set on the [theme] configuration
option. Any file in the `theme_dir` with the same name as a file in the `theme`
will replace the file of the same name in the `theme`. Any additional files in
the `theme_dir` will be added to the `theme`. The contents of the `theme_dir`
should mirror the directory structure of the `theme`. You may include templates,
JavaScript files, CSS files, images, fonts, or any other media included in a
theme.

!!! Note

    For this to work, the `theme` setting must be set to a known installed theme.
    If the `theme` settign is instead set to `null`, then there is no theme to
    override and the contents of the `theme_dir` must be a complete, standalone
    theme. See [Custom Themes][custom theme] for more information.

For example, the [mkdocs] theme ([browse source]), contains the following
directory structure (in part):

```nohighlight
- css\
- fonts\
- img\
  - favicon.ico
  - grid.png
- js\
- 404.html
- base.html
- content.html
- nav-sub.html
- nav.html
- toc.html
```

To override any of the files contained in that theme, create a new directory
next to your `docs_dir`:

```bash
mkdir custom_theme
```

And then point your `mkdocs.yml` configuration file at the new directory:

```yaml
theme_dir: custom_theme
```

To override the 404 error page ("file not found"), add a new template file named
`404.html` to the `custom_theme` directory. For information on what can be
included in a template, review the documentation for building a [custom theme].

To override the favicon, you can add a new icon file at
`custom_theme/img/favicon.ico`.

To include a JavaScript library, copy the library to the `custom_theme/js/`
directory.

Your directory structure should now look like this:

```nohighlight
- docs/
  - index.html
- custom_theme/
  - img/
    - favicon.ico
  - js/
    - somelib.js
  - 404.html
- config.yml
```

!!! Note

    Any files included in the `theme` but not included in the `theme_dir` will
    still be utilized. The `theme_dir` will only override/replace files in the
    `theme`. If you want to remove files, or build a theme from scratch, then
    you should review the documentation for building a [custom theme].

#### Overriding Template Blocks

The built-in themes implement many of their parts inside template blocks which
can be individually overridden in the `main.html` template. Simply create a
`main.html` template file in your `theme_dir` and define replacement blocks
within that file. Just make sure that the `main.html` extends `base.html`. For
example, to alter the title of the MkDocs theme, your replacement `main.html`
template would contain the following:

```django
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}
<title>Custom title goes here</title>
{% endblock %}
```

In the above example, the title block defined in your custom `main.html` file
will be used in place of the default title block defined in the parent theme.
You may re-define as many blocks as you desire, as long as those blocks are
defined in the parent. For example, you could replace the Google Analytics
script with one for a different service or replace the search feature with your
own. You will need to consult the parent theme you are using to determine what
blocks are available to override. The MkDocs and ReadTheDocs themes provide the
following blocks:

* `site_meta`: Contains meta tags in the document head.
* `htmltitle`: Contains the page title in the document head.
* `styles`: Contains the link tags for stylesheets.
* `libs`: Contains the JavaScript libraries (jQuery, etc) included in the page header.
* `scripts`: Contains JavaScript scripts which should execute after a page loads.
* `analytics`: Contains the analytics script.
* `extrahead`: An empty block in the `<head>` to insert custom tags/scripts/etc.
* `site_name`: Contains the site name in the navigation bar.
* `site_nav`: Contains the site navigation in the navigation bar.
* `search_box`: Contains the search box in the navigation bar.
* `next_prev`: Contains the next and previous buttons in the navigation bar.
* `repo`: Contains the repository link in the navigation bar.
* `content`: Contains the page content and table of contents for the page.
* `footer`: Contains the page footer.

You may need to view the source template files to ensure your modifications will
work with the structure of the site. See [Template Variables] for a list of
variables you can use within your custom blocks. For a more complete
explaination of blocks, consult the [Jinja documentation].
