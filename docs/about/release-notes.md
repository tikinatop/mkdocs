## Upgrading

To upgrade MkDocs to the latest version, use pip:

    pip install -U mkdocs

You can determine your currently installed version using `mkdocs --version`:

    $ mkdocs --version
    mkdocs, version 0.15.2

## Version 0.16 (2016-02-??)

### Major Additions to Version 0.16.0

#### Template variables refactored. (#874)

##### Page Context

Page specific variable names in the template context have been refactored as
defined in [Custom Themes](../user-guide/custom-themes/#page). The
old variable names will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16,
but may be removed in a future version.

Any of the following old page variables should be updated to the new ones in
user created and third-party templates:

| Old Variable Name | New Variable Name   |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| current_page      | [page]              |
| page_title        | [page.title]        |
| content           | [page.content]      |
| toc               | [page.toc]          |
| meta              | [page.meta]         |
| canonical_url     | [page.canonical_url]|
| previous_page     | [page.previous_page]|
| next_page         | [page.next_page]    |

[page]: ../user-guide/custom-themes/#page
[page.title]: ../user-guide/custom-themes/#pagetitle
[page.content]: ../user-guide/custom-themes/#pagecontent
[page.toc]: ../user-guide/custom-themes/#pagetoc
[page.meta]: ../user-guide/custom-themes/#pagemeta
[page.canonical_url]: ../user-guide/custom-themes/#pagecanonical_url
[page.previous_page]: ../user-guide/custom-themes/#pageprevious_page
[page.next_page]: ../user-guide/custom-themes/#pagenext_page

##### Global Context

Additionally, a number of global variables have been altered and/or deprecated
and user created and third-party templates should be updated as outlined below:

Previously, the global variable `include_nav` was altered programmatically based
on the number of pages in the nav. The variable will issue a warning but
continue to work for version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use
`{% if nav|length>1 %}` instead.

Previously, the global variable `include_next_prev` was altered programmatically
based on the number of pages in the nav. The variable will issue a warning but
continue to work for version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use
`{% if page.next_page or page.previous_page %}` instead.

Previously the global variable `page_description` was altered programmatically
based on whether the current page was the homepage. Now it simply maps to
`config['site_description']`. Use `{% if page.is_homepage %}` in the template to
conditionally change the description.

The global variable `homepage_url` maps directly to `nav.homepage.url` and is
being deprecated. The variable will issue a warning but continue to work for
version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use `nav.homepage.url`
instead.

The global variable `favicon` maps to the configuration setting `site_favicon`.
Both the template variable and the configuration setting are being deprecated
and will issue a warning but continue to work for version 0.16, and may be
removed in a future version. Use `{{ base_url }}/img/favicon.ico` in your
template instead. Users can simply save a copy of their custom favicon icon to
`img/favicon.ico` in either their `docs_dir` or `theme_dir`.

A number of variables map directly to similarly named variables in the `config`.
Those variables are being deprecated and will issue a warning but continue to
work for version 0.16, but may be removed in a future version. Use
`config.var_name` instead, where `var_name` is the name of one of the
[configuration] variables.

[configuration]: /user-guide/configuration.md

Below is a summary of all of the changes made to the global context:

| Old Variable Name | New Variable Name or Expression        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| current_page      | page                                   |
| include_nav       | nav&#124;length&gt;1                   |
| include_next_prev | (page.next_page or page.previous_page) |
| site_name         | config.site_name                       |
| site_author       | config.site_author                     |
| page_description  | config.site_description                |
| repo_url          | config.repo_url                        |
| repo_name         | config.repo_name                       |
| site_url          | config.site_url                        |
| copyright         | config.copyright                       |
| google_analytics  | config.google_analytics                |
| homepage_url      | nav.homepage.url                       |
| favicon           | {{ base_url }}/img/favicon.ico         |

#### Increased Template Customization. (#607)

The built-in themes have been updated by having each of their many parts wrapped
in template blocks which allow each individual block to be easily overridden
using the `theme_dir` config setting. Without any new settings, you can use a
different analytics service, replace the default search function, or alter the
behavior of the navigation, among other things. See the relevant
[documentation][blocks] for more details.

To enable this feature, the primary entry point for page templates has been
changed from `base.html` to `main.html`. This allows `base.html` to continue to
exist while allowing users to override `main.html` and extend `base.html`. For
version 0.16, `base.html` will continue to work if no `main.html` template
exists, but it is deprecated and will raise a warning. In version 1.0, a build
will fail if no `main.html` template exists. Any custom and third party
templates should be updated accordingly.

The easiest way for a third party theme to be updated would be to simply add a
`main.html` file which only contains the following line:

```django
{% extends "base.html" %}
```

That way, the theme contains the `main.html` entry point, and also supports
overriding blocks in the same manner as the built-in themes. Third party themes
are encouraged to wrap the various pieces of their templates in blocks in order
to support such customization.

[blocks]: ../user-guide/styling-your-docs/#overriding-template-blocks

#### Auto-Populated `extra_css` and `extra_javascript` Deprecated. (#986)

In previous versions of MkDocs, if the `extra_css` or `extra_javascript` config
settings were empty, MkDocs would scan the `docs_dir` and auto-populate each
setting with all of the CSS and JavaScript files found. This behavior is
deprecated and a warning will be issued. In the next release, the auto-populate
feature will stop working and any unlisted CSS and JavaScript files will not be
included in the HTML templates. In other words, they will still be copied to the
`site-dir`, but they will not have any effect on the theme if they are not
explicitly listed.

All CSS and javaScript files in the `docs_dir` should be explicitly listed in
the `extra_css` or `extra_javascript` config settings going forward.

#### Support for dirty builds. (#990)

For large sites the build time required to create the pages can become problematic,
thus a "dirty" build mode was created. This mode simply compares the modified time
of the generated HTML and source markdown. If the markdown has changed since the
HTML then the page is re-constructed. Otherwise, the page remains as is. This mode
may be invoked in both the `mkdocs serve` and `mkdocs build` commands:

```text
mkdocs serve --dirtyreload
```

```text
mkdocs build --dirty
```

It is important to note that this method for building the pages is for development
of content only, since the navigation and other links do not get updated on other
pages.

#### Stricter Directory Validation

Previously, a warning was issued if the `site_dir` was a child directory of the
`docs_dir`. This now raises an error. Additionally, an error is now raised if
the `docs_dir` is set to the directory which contains your config file rather
than a child directory. You will need to rearrange you directory structure to
better conform with the documented [layout].

### Deprecations to Version 0.13.0

#### Deprecate the JSON command

In this release the  `mkdocs json` command has been marked as deprecated and
when used a deprecation warning will be shown. It will be removed in a [future
release] of MkDocs, version 1.0 at the latest. The `mkdocs json` command
provided  a convenient way for users to output the documentation contents as
JSON files but with the additions of search to MkDocs this functionality is
duplicated.

A new index with all the contents from a MkDocs build is created in the
[site_dir], so with the default value for the `site_dir` It can be found in
`site/mkdocs/search_index.json`.

This new file is created on every MkDocs build (with `mkdocs build`) and
no configuration is needed to enable it.

[future release]: https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/pull/481
[site_dir]: /user-guide/configuration.md#site_dir

#### Change the pages configuration

Provide a [new way] to define pages, and specifically [nested pages], in the
mkdocs.yml file and deprecate the existing approach, support will be removed
with MkDocs 1.0.

[new way]: /user-guide/writing-your-docs.md#configure-pages-and-navigation
[nested pages]: /user-guide/writing-your-docs.md#multilevel-documentation

#### Warn users about the removal of builtin themes

All themes other than mkdocs and readthedocs will be moved into external
packages in a future release of MkDocs. This will enable them to be more easily
supported and updates outside MkDocs releases.

### Major Additions to Version 0.13.0

#### Search

Support for search has now been added to MkDocs. This is based on the
JavaScript library [lunr.js]. It has been added to both the `mkdocs` and
`readthedocs` themes. See the custom theme documentation on [supporting search]
for adding it to your own themes.

[lunr.js]: http://lunrjs.com/
[supporting search]: /user-guide/styling-your-docs.md#search-and-themes

#### New Command Line Interface

The command line interface for MkDocs has been re-written with the Python
library [Click]. This means that MkDocs now has an easier to use interface
with better help output.

This change is partially backwards incompatible as while undocumented it was
possible to pass any configuration option to the different commands. Now only
a small subset of the configuration options can be passed to the commands. To
see in full commands and available arguments use `mkdocs --help` and
`mkdocs build --help` to have them displayed.

[Click]: http://click.pocoo.org/4/

#### Support Extra HTML and XML files

Like the [extra_javascript] and [extra_css] configuration options, a new
option named [extra_templates] has been added. This will automatically be
populated with any `.html` or `.xml` files in the project docs directory.

Users can place static HTML and XML files and they will be copied over, or they
can also use Jinja2 syntax and take advantage of the [global variables].

By default MkDocs will use this approach to create a sitemap for the
documentation.

[extra_javascript]: /user-guide/configuration.md#extra_javascript
[extra_css]: /user-guide/configuration.md#extra_css
[extra_templates]: /user-guide/configuration.md#extra_templates
[global variables]: /user-guide/styling-your-docs.md#global-context
